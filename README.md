# GoMotivation
	GoMotivation is a time management fitness webapp for busy people who want to exercise but need the push to do so. 
	It does this by having a calender system that breaks down time spent on different types of activities such as work, exercise, etc., and recommends different exercises based on this. 
	Likewise, there is also a level up reward system that gets the user addicted. 

Features and API include a calendar API, and web storage API as well as cookies to be able to store and access data on the browser.
